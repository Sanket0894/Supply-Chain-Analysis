## Supply Chain Analysis
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG company that makes everyday products. They're based in Gujarat, India, and right now, they operate in three cities there. But they want to start selling their products in bigger cities over the next two years.

Here's the issue: Some important customers didn't want to keep doing business with AtliQ Mart because they had problems with the service. It seems like sometimes the products they ordered didn't arrive on time or they didn't get everything they asked for. This made the customers unhappy.

Now, AtliQ Mart wants to fix this problem before they start selling in more cities. They asked their supply chain team for help. The supply chain team decided to check every day how often they deliver things on time and in full to customers. They'll measure this using three things: 'On-time delivery (OT) %,' 'In-full delivery (IF) %,' and 'On-time in full (OTIF) %' for each customer. This way, they can make sure they're doing a good job and make customers happy
